3.5 Ontology Construction and Annotation Framework

This section details the multi-phase methodology adopted for constructing the Amharic news ontology and its associated annotation framework. The process integrates corpus-driven automatic extraction, expert-guided semantic validation, and formal ontology engineering, ensuring both linguistic robustness and computational applicability for ontology-based feature fusion.

3.5.1 Phase 1: Corpus Analysis and Automated Concept Extraction

An extensive corpus analysis was performed on a large-scale Amharic news dataset consisting of 61,915 articles collected from multiple Ethiopian news outlets. The objective of this phase was to automatically identify candidate semantic concepts that frequently occur across the corpus and exhibit potential discriminative power for news classification.

Automated Keyword and Phrase Extraction

Frequent noun phrases and named entities were extracted using Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE), selected due to its language-independent design and suitability for low-resource languages such as Amharic. Prior to extraction, the corpus underwent normalization steps including:

Unicode normalization

Removal of punctuation and non-lexical symbols

Sentence segmentation adapted to Amharic syntax

To reduce noise and ensure semantic relevance, a minimum document frequency threshold of 50 occurrences was enforced. Only terms meeting or exceeding this threshold were retained as candidate ontology concepts.

This filtering strategy ensured that extracted concepts:

Represented recurring themes in Ethiopian news discourse

Avoided sparse or idiosyncratic terms

Supported stable statistical modeling in downstream classification tasks

3.5.2 Phase 2: Expert Annotation, Conceptualization, and Hierarchical Structuring
Expert Annotation Protocol

The refinement and validation of automatically extracted concepts were conducted by three native Amharic-speaking annotators, each with more than five years of professional journalism experience. Their domain expertise ensured accurate interpretation of political, social, and cultural nuances present in Amharic news texts.

The annotation process was organized into four iterative annotation sessions, each serving a distinct purpose:

Initial concept validation

Semantic consolidation and synonym resolution

Hierarchical categorization

Final consistency verification

During each session, annotators followed explicit annotation guidelines specifying inclusion and exclusion criteria based on:

Corpus-level frequency

Semantic clarity and unambiguity

Discriminative relevance for classification

Alignment with real-world news taxonomy

Concepts deemed overly generic, contextually ambiguous, or weakly discriminative were either removed or merged with semantically equivalent concepts.

Conceptualization and Ontology Hierarchy Design

The finalized ontology adopts a three-tier hierarchical structure designed to capture semantic relationships at multiple abstraction levels while supporting flexible feature fusion.

Top-Level Classes (6)

Six top-level classes represent the primary thematic domains of Ethiopian news coverage:

Politics

Sports

Business

Entertainment

National News

International News

These classes serve as coarse-grained semantic anchors for document classification.

Mid-Level Subclasses (24)

Each top-level class is further subdivided into domain-specific conceptual categories, enabling finer semantic granularity. Examples include:

Politics
Elections, Governance, ForeignPolicy, Legislation, PoliticalParties

Sports
Football, Athletics, Basketball, Olympics, TeamSports

Business
Economy, Finance, Trade, Companies, Markets

These subclasses capture recurring thematic patterns commonly observed in Amharic news reporting.

Leaf-Level Instances (187)

The lowest ontology layer consists of 187 leaf-level instances, representing concrete real-world entities, including:

Political parties (e.g., NAMA)

Sports teams (e.g., Fasil Kenema)

Corporate organizations

Government institutions

Geographic locations

Prominent individuals

This level supports entity-aware feature representation and enhances semantic specificity during classification.

3.5.3 Phase 3: Formal Ontology Implementation Using OWL 2 DL
Ontology Representation Language

The ontology was formally implemented using OWL 2 DL, chosen for its balance between expressiveness and decidability. OWL 2 DL enables rich semantic modeling while supporting automated reasoning and consistency verification.

Reasoning and Validation

Logical consistency and inferencing were validated using the HermiT reasoner, which enabled:

Detection of class inconsistencies

Verification of property constraints

Validation of hierarchical relationships

Object Properties

The ontology defines several object properties to model semantic relationships:

hasTopic
Links a news document to a primary ontological concept
(Functional property)

isRelatedTo
Represents associative semantic relationships between concepts
(Symmetric, transitive)

isPartOf
Encodes part-whole relationships within events or organizations
(Asymmetric, transitive)

hasSubEvent
Models hierarchical event structures for temporally nested news events

Data Properties

To incorporate quantitative and temporal metadata, the following data properties were defined:

hasFrequency
Represents the document frequency of a concept across the corpus

hasDiscriminativePower
Encodes information gain scores used in feature selection

lastUpdated
Tracks ontology evolution and supports dynamic maintenance

Logical Axioms and Constraints

A total of 156 logical axioms were defined, encompassing:

Domain and range restrictions

Property characteristics

Class disjointness assertions

Equivalence and subsumption relationships

These axioms ensure semantic precision, prevent logical contradictions, and enforce domain relevance.

3.5.4 Inter-Annotator Agreement and Conflict Resolution

Annotation reliability was evaluated using Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, achieving a high agreement score of κ = 0.85, which indicates strong inter-annotator consistency.

Disagreements were resolved through a structured conflict-resolution protocol:

Collaborative discussion among annotators

Majority voting when consensus was not reached after two discussion rounds

Consultation with additional domain experts for persistent disagreements
(required in 4.2% of annotated cases)

3.5.5 Cross-Validation with External Linguistic Resources

To further ensure linguistic validity and semantic accuracy, the finalized ontology concepts were cross-validated against established Amharic linguistic resources, including:

HornMorpho morphological lexicon

Ongoing Amharic WordNet development initiatives 

This validation step enhanced the ontology’s linguistic grounding and interoperability with existing low-resource language tools.
